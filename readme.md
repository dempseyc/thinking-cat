# Thinking Cat
### An experimental personality-test game

---

The user creates a profile, giving themselves a cat-name, after being prompted by... none-other-than... t.s. Elliot, in his poem "The Naming of Cats."

Each 'cat' navigates a virtual environment until they reach an ending where their 'cat-story' is stored in the database and then compared with the stories of other players. They are shown their results in the context of this comparison.

The interaction design of this game is inspired by my earliest programming experience as a child, when, finding that with Apple's HyperCard application, on an old computer that my mom brought home from her work, I could possibly create a game. I was 12 years old give or take a couple of years, and began building a game like this one, with clickable areas allowing the user to navigate a simple 3D maze. For me today, this project is an exploration of web development, utilizing tools such as JavaScript, Jquery, Node.js with Express, D3.js, and Postgres.

### The Naming Of Cats
#### -- t.s. Elliot

#### The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
#### It isn't just one of your holiday games;
#### You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter
#### When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
#### First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,
#### Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,
#### Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—
#### All of them sensible everyday names.
#### There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
#### Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
#### Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
#### But all of them sensible everyday names.
#### But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,
#### A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,
#### Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
#### Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
#### Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
#### Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
#### Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum-
#### Names that never belong to more than one cat.
#### But above and beyond there's still one name left over,
#### And that is the name that you never will guess;
#### The name that no human research can discover—
#### But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
#### When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
#### The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
#### His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
#### Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
#### His ineffable effable
#### Effanineffable
#### Deep and inscrutable singular Name.
